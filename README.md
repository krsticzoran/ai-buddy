The app is built in React and Bootstrap.
The project was primarily created to gain experience in React and practice using various React features such as useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext, Redux Toolkit, useCallback, and React.memo.

In addition to honing React skills, this project also emphasizes practicing testing using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application through comprehensive unit tests.
